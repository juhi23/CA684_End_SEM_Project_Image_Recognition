# CA684_End_SEM_Project_Image_Recognition
This Project Code written in Python using Google's Tensorflow library is for the Image Classifiaction on the Cat vs Dog Dataset.

The dataset is divided into Traing and Test Data:
<br/>Training data has 25000 Images of cat and Dogs which with labels is further splitted into:
<br/>Training data: 17500 Images
<br/>Testing data : 5000 Images
<br/>Validation data : 2500 Images
<br/>And The Testing data without the labels has 12500 Images 


<br/> The algorithm used for training the Model used is the convolutional Neural Network
<br/> The Network Architecture is the modified version of the Alexnet.
